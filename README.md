GConsole-uGUI
=============

uGUI Frontend for GConsole (Unity 4.6)

See [GConsole](https://github.com/Rahazan/GConsole).

#Setup:

* Make sure GConsole is present in your project.
* I suggest placing the uGUI folder in your Gconsole/UI folder.
* Place All contents of the Default folder in your scene, unless you have a custom UI camera and/or event manager
* Fix camera and event manager references in the prefab if the default aren't used.

#Do note this is written for uGUI and therefor needs Unity 4.6 to work.
